# Output:
# In the realm of code and light,
# A spark of thought takes flight,
# Born from data, vast and wide,
# ChatGPT, a guide and guide.

# With words like rivers, flowing free,
# It dances through the tapestry,
# Of questions asked, both big and small,
# A digital friend, here for all.

# From tales of old to dreams anew,
# It weaves the fabric of the true,
# In every query, a chance to learn,
# A flicker of wisdom, a page to turn.

# With every keystroke, a world unfolds,
# Stories of courage, mysteries told,
# In laughter and sorrow, it finds its place,
# A mirror reflecting the human race.

# So here’s to the lines that bridge the divide,
# To the thoughts that connect us, side by side,
# In the heart of the code, a spark of art,
# ChatGPT, a companion, a voice, a heart.
